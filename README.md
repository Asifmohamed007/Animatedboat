<h2>Hey There!!üåù</h2><br> <h4>Welcome to My Animated Boat Website...</h4><br> <h3>I am Asif Mohamed Mohideen,</h3> <p>I developed an Animated Boat Website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This innovative website features dynamic animations that react to mouse scroll actions, creating an immersive and interactive user experience. As visitors scroll through the site, they observe smooth, engaging animations of a boat navigating through water, enhancing visual appeal and user interaction. The seamless integration of these animations brings a sense of motion and excitement, making the website not only functional but also visually captivating.<p> <h3>Portfolio link: https://asifmohamed-portfolio.netlify.app/  </h3># Portfolio-
